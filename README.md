# Heelo
Heelo is an Arduino-based pan/tilt robot that uses a Pixy for object tracking.
This is my first real project, please be gentle.

# Goals
I'd like to make Heelo interactive. This means making up games that take advantage of the PIXY's ability to track color, and using that data to give Heelo a set of actions that come across as personality.
